Bhaiaji Superhit received a lukewarm response from the critics and the audience, who found the movie outdated, illogical and unfunny. The movie was criticized for its stale writing, poor direction, weak editing and over-the-top action scenes. The movie was also accused of being a rip-off of Salman Khan's Dabangg franchise, but without the charm and charisma of the superstar. The only saving grace of the movie was said to be the performances of Sunny Deol and Preity Zinta, who shared a good chemistry on screen after a long time. Arshad Warsi and Shreyas Talpade also managed to evoke some laughs with their comic timing.
 
Bhaiaji Superhit was a box office flop, as it failed to recover its production cost of â¹30 crore. The movie faced stiff competition from other releases like 2.0, Badhaai Ho and Andhadhun, which were still running successfully in theatres. The movie also suffered from poor marketing and promotion, as it was delayed for several years due to financial and legal issues. The movie was released on 23 November 2018 on around 1500 screens across India, but could only collect â¹1.20 crore on its opening day. The movie's lifetime collection was estimated to be around â¹6.25 crore.
 
Bhaiaji Superhit is a movie that can be easily skipped, as it offers nothing new or exciting to the viewers. The movie is a wasted opportunity for Sunny Deol, who could have chosen a better script and director for his comeback. The movie is a disappointment for the fans of Preity Zinta, who deserved a better comeback vehicle after her hiatus. The movie is a torture for the lovers of good cinema, who would find it hard to sit through this mess.
